Description: Usually the cluster labels are associated with the different components of the mixture, but they may not be separate enough to be labelled as separate cluster. In this chapter we therefore introduce the ridgeline function and the ratio of the ridgeline as tools to find natural grouping in the data by merging the components of  the mixture of multivariate skew normal distribution. In the context of normal mixture the same technique has been used by Hennig (2010) based on the ridgeline elevation plots of Ray and Lindsay (2005).
